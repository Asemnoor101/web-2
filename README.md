# Hand Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Hand Prediction System** utilizes machine learning to recognize and classify different **hand gestures** in real-time using your device’s camera. This system is designed for applications such as **gesture-based controls, sign language recognition, and interactive AI projects**.

---

## 🎯 Features
- ✔️ **Accurate real-time hand gesture recognition**
- ✔️ **Live camera integration for instant feedback**
- ✔️ **Detection counter to track predictions**
- ✔️ **Reset option to clear previous counts**

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Click **"Start Prediction"** to activate the camera.
2. The system analyzes hand gestures and **displays the detected sign with a confidence score**.
3. The **detection counter** updates every time a new gesture is recognized.
4. Click **"Reset Counter"** to clear the previous count.

## 📡 Machine Learning Model Used
This system is powered by a pre-trained **Teachable Machine model**, which has been trained to classify multiple hand gestures accurately.
